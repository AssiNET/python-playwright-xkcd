# Python Playwright UI Framework:
This framework was built using the Python programming language and utilizes Playwright as its testing tool. In addition to the default Playwright reports, the framework includes a reporting mechanism that generates human-readable HTML reports.

The results of the tests are easily accessible in the timestamped reports directory located at
`project_root/reports/{timestamp}.html.`

To run the framework and execute tests, simply run the following command at the root level:

# Run the framework and execute tests by simply run pytest at root level
```
pytest
```

# TODO
In the future the framework should be developed to run against different environment
